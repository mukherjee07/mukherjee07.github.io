**I am a Chemical Engineer with interest in computational materials discovery and process optimization using molecular modeling, statistics, and data science. 
My current research at University of Notre Dame is focused on applying molecular simulations (monte carlo and molecular dynamics), machine learning, and statistics to understand adsorption, selectivity, and other properties in nanoporous structures.**
